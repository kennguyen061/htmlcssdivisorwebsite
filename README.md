You have completed the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)! You may submit your project now or improve your project with the considerations below.
Considerations:
Labeling inputs helps guide your user to doing the right thing.
What should your program do if it is run multiple times?
Extra Considerations:
Judicious use of color and styling helps highlight what is important on the page.
Having styling live in its own file helps decouple your HTML from the styling.
Having JavaScript live in its own file makes writing automated tests easier.
Bonus Considertions:
Write automated tests for any JavaScript you write. You should provide instructions in .js file how to setup and run the tests.
Flexbox or CSS Grid can make your page responsive (i.e., able to look good on any screen).
