    <p>For this project you will demonstrate how to accept two numbers, divide the first by the second, and show the result.  You will use HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Please complete this project and submit your finished project back to Hayden when you are finished.  We will discuss the work you did on this project during the interview.</p>

            User Interface (UI) requirements:
            <ol>
                <li>Add a textbox to enter a number</li>
				<li>Add a another textbox to enter a second number</li>
                <li>Add a button labeled "Calculate".</li>
				<li>Add a label to show the result.</li>

            Business requirements:
            <p>When the button is clicked, </p>
            <ol>
                <li>When the button is clicked, divide the first number by the second number and show the results in the label.</li>
                <li>Use a JavaScript function to perforrm your calculation.</li>
                <li>Best practices dictate validating input prior to doing anything with it.</li>
                <li>Remember and apply the math rules you know for division and decimal points.</li>
                <li>You have completed the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)! You may submit your project now or improve your project with the considerations below.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Considerations:
            <ol>
                <li>Labeling inputs helps guide your user to doing the right thing.</li>
                <li>What should your program do if it is run multiple times?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Extra Considerations:
            <ol>
                <li>Judicious use of color and styling helps highlight what is important on the page.</li>
                <li>Having styling live in its own file helps decouple your HTML from the styling.</li>
				<li>Having JavaScript live in its own file makes writing automated tests easier.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div>
            Bonus Considertions:
            <ol>
                <li>Write automated tests for any JavaScript you write.  You should provide instructions in .js file how to setup and run the tests.</li>
                <li>Flexbox or CSS Grid can make your page responsive (i.e., able to look good on any screen).</li>
            </ol>
